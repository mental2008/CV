& \textbf{Resource Management for AI/GPU Clusters} \\
& \textit{\emph{Mitigate GPU Resource Fragmentation}} \\
    & $\diamond$
    [\textbf{Under review}]
    Proposed the \textit{first} GPU-disaggregated DLRM serving system to eliminate \textit{resource mismatch} and meet \textit{elastic} demand.
    By leveraging RDMA network to compute the computation graph on GPU and CPU nodes separately, it reduced CPU fragments by 53\% and GPU fragments by 27\%.
    Saved up to 90\% of GPUs when loaning GPU servers from training clusters, during the seasonal traffic peaks (e.g., Double 11 Shopping Festival). \\

    & $\diamond$ [\textbf{ATC 2023}] Formally quantified \textit{statistical GPU resource fragments} and proposed the \textit{fragmentation gradient descent} scheduling algorithm to reduce resource fragmentation. Our scheduling policy can significantly improve GPU allocation rate by 3\% compared to state-of-the-art policies. [\href{https://github.com/hkust-adsl/kubernetes-scheduler-simulator}{\underline{code}}] \\
    & $\diamond$ Developed \textit{ParaSet}, a \textit{best-effort} workload on Kubernetes that can dynamically adjust the number of instances and resource requirements based on the real-time resource availability in the cluster. It aims to fill resource fragments in the cluster and is integrated into KubeDL for internal use. \\
& \textit{\emph{Large-Scale GPU Sharing in Production}} \\
    & $\diamond$ Enabled \textit{large-scale GPU sharing} in production clusters, with over 10k shared GPU containers running on a daily basis. Support the co-location of GPU tasks with different priorities (e.g., \textit{latency-sensitive}, \textit{best-effort}). \\
    % & $\diamond$ This was a multi-team collaborative project. I was responsible for the design and implementation of the single-node agent and the centralized controller. The agent periodically collects and reports resource usage metrics, as well as dynamically allocates GPU resources to containers. The controller calculates potential overcommitment of resources and provides scheduling guidance to the scheduler. \\
    & $\diamond$ Specifically, I designed and implementated the node-level agent and the cluster-level controller. The agent periodically collects and reports resource usage metrics, as well as dynamically allocates GPU resources to different containers. The controller calculates potential resource overcommitment and provides scheduling guidance to the cluster scheduler. \\
& \textbf{Efficient and Low-cost AI Model Serving Systems} \\
& \textit{\emph{Efficient Diffusion Model Serving with Add-on Modules}} \\
    & $\diamond$ \textbf{[Under review]} Developed SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently generates high-quality images with stable diffusion models and add-on modules (i.e., ControlNets and LoRAs). Incorporated serveral novel designs, including ControlNet-as-a-Service, asynchronous LoRA loading, and kernel optimization. Achieved up to $5 \times$ in latency and $2 \times$ in throughput without sacrificing image quality.\\
& \textit{\emph{Auto-Configuration for AI Serving Service}} \\
    & $\diamond$
    [\textbf{SoCC 2021}]
    Developed Morphling, an open-source auto-configuration framework for AI serving on Kubernetes.
    Combined \textit{meta-learning} and \textit{bayesian optimization} to quickly find the \textit{optimal} configuration.
    It was widely used in Alibaba for automated recommendation of container resource specifications. [\href{https://github.com/kubedl-io/morphling}{\underline{code}}] \\
